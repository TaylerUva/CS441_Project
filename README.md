## NOTE:

Pages need to have the following lines as attributes to work on iPhone X and above.

```
xmlns:ios="clr-namespace:Xamarin.Forms.PlatformConfiguration.iOSSpecific;assembly=Xamarin.Forms.Core" 
ios:Page.UseSafeArea="true"
```
Put these two lines were the other 'xmlns' are called in the .xaml file.
